I know a lot of this is... less than optimum, but it is all functional. But yes I acknowledge that it's a work in progress. Wanna help me clean it up? Go fork yourself a copy.

Also **PLEASE** be aware that files are currently being written to the same directory. Each type of file, workout log, nano log, notes log, will create a separate file with the date and the type of file in the name. It can get messy.
